# HieroGIF

![HieroGIF Preview](preview.png)

HieroGIF is a Chrome Extension that greets you with a fresh gif every time you open a new tab!

You can get HieroGIF on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hierogif/dljfgojpciopkpbdciemghiagpoliebl).

If you want to modify the extension from this repo, you'll need to request a Giphy API key (get started [here](https://developers.giphy.com/)), and add it to Giphy.js

GiphyTab's styling is based off the "Identity" template from [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/).
You can find the original README for the Identity template below.

Just a fun little profile/card-style template I whipped up during a break between major
projects. Minimal, responsive, and powered by Skel + Sass. Enjoy :)
